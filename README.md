# Wikilacra
This project listens to the Wikipedia revision stream, and selects pages
which receive more than 15 edits in an hour. It observes the edit
traffic and then uses machine learning to try to predict whether or not
these pages are likely being edited in correspondence with an external
event (e.g. the release of a film trailer). For details, see my
<a href="https://jtlaune.github.io/writing/wikilacra">blog post</a> on the project.
